### üìä Overview

This project explores the **data job market**, with a focus on **data roles**. I wanted to better understand which skills are most valuable and which jobs pay the best ‚Äî and help others do the same.

Using [Luke Barousse's Data Jobs Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lukebarousse/data_jobs), I looked at job titles, salaries, locations, and required skills. With the help of Python, I answered questions like:

- What skills are companies looking for most?
- Which roles offer the highest salaries?
- Where do demand and salary meet for the best opportunities?

If you're aiming for a job in data ‚Äî or just curious about the field ‚Äî this analysis offers a clear picture of where the opportunities are.

### ‚ú® The Questions

These are the key questions I set out to answer in this project:

1. **Which skills are most in demand** for the top 3 data job roles?
2. **Which skills are becoming more popular** over time in data jobs?
3. **Which jobs and skills pay the best** in the data field?
4. **What are the best skills to learn** ‚Äî the ones that are both high in demand and high in salary?

### üß∞ Tools I Used

To explore the data analyst job market, I used a set of powerful tools:

- **Python:** The core of my analysis ‚Äî used to clean, explore, and analyze the data.
  - **Pandas:** For working with and analyzing data.
  - **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** To create clear and insightful visualizations.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My main code editor for writing and testing Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Used for version control and sharing my project online.

### üßπ Data Preparation

Before diving into the analysis, I cleaned and organized the data to make sure everything was accurate and ready to use.

#### üîç Step 1: Import Libraries & Load Data

I started by importing the tools and loading the dataset.

```python
# Importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ast
from datasets import load_dataset

# Loading the dataset
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()
```

#### üßº Step 2: Clean the Data

I did some basic cleanup like fixing date formats and converting skills from strings to lists.

```python
# Convert date column to datetime format
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])

# Convert job_skills from string to list
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

### Filter India Jobs

To focus on the Indian job market, I filtered the dataset to include only jobs based in **India**. This helped narrow down the analysis to relevant roles.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'India']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Here‚Äôs how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [2_Skill_Demand](project/2_skill_demand.ipynb).

### Visualize Data

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles),1)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_percent[df_skills_percent['job_title_short'] == job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot,x = 'skill_percent',y = 'job_skills',ax = ax[i],hue = 'skill_percent',palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)
    ax[i].set_ylabel("")
    ax[i].set_xlabel("")
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,75)

    for n, val in enumerate(df_plot['skill_percent']):
        ax[i].text(val + 1.5, n , f"{round(val)}%",va = 'center',fontsize = 10)
    


fig.suptitle('LIkelihood of skills requested in jobs',fontsize = 15)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5)
plt.show()
```

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](project/4_salary_analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short', order=job_order)

ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

#### Results

Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.

#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1)  

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')

# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')

plt.show()

```

#### Results
Here's the breakdown of the highest-paid & most in-demand skills for data analysts in the US:

## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Roles?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](project/5_optimal_skills.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text

plt.scatter(df_skills['skill_percent'], df_skills['median_salary'])
plt.xlabel('Percent of Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Salary ($USD)')  
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Roles in India')
plt.ylim(0,200000)

ax = plt.gca()
ax.yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))  # Example formatting y-axis

texts = []
for i, txt in enumerate(df_skills.index):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_skills['skill_percent'].iloc[i], df_skills['median_salary'].iloc[i], " " + txt))

adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))

plt.show()

```
